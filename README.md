Our Folder names are pretty self explanitory, arduino code has all of our code, PCB has all of out PCB files, Enclosure has all of our Enclosure SLT files and extra has basically anything that doesn't fit into those catagories (like our BOMs, sudocode, and earlier presentation files).

To reproduce this design:
  - PCB gerber files: PCB/Beta_BOPIT_37mmX40mm.zip
  - Components on PCB: Extra/Beta_BopIt_Essentials.csv
  - Input/Output Components: Extra/Beta_BopIt_IO.csv
  - Enclosure files: Enclosure/Lid (1).ipt, Enclosure/Main Enclosure v5.ipt
  - Final Bop It Code: Adruino_code/bop-it.ino
